Our vocational rehabilitation services aim to help individuals with functional, psychological, developmental, cognitive, or emotional disabilities and health impairments to overcome any barriers that prevent them from accessing, maintaining, or returning to employment or other useful occupations. This involves collaboration with various healthcare professionals, as well as non-medical disciplines such as disability employment advisers and career counsellors.

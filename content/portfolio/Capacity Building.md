Our capacity-building services support individuals in enhancing their daily living skills and independence. We offer tailored therapies, including social work, psychosocial occupational therapy (OT), and assistance from therapy aides. For young children (under 7 years), our Early Childhood Key Workers provide holistic support to promote development and family engagement.

What do NDIS therapeutic supports entail?

NDIS therapeutic supports are an essential aspect of support for many NDIS participants, and are often funded in their plans. These supports are designed to help improve your independence and participation in everyday activities. There are a variety of therapeutic supports available, and they must be provided by qualified service providers.

NDIS therapeutic supports are divided into three categories in your plan: Improved Daily Living, Improved Relationships, and Improved Health & Wellbeing. The Improved Daily Living category covers supports to help with daily living skills, while the Improved Relationships category focuses on helping you interact with others. The Improved Health & Wellbeing category covers activities to support or increase your physical mobility and wellbeing.

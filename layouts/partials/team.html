        <div style="padding: 20px;  background:aliceblue;" class="col-lg-6 col-md-5;"><h3>Tamara</h3><p>I'm a social worker for people with disabilities and I love my job. I get to work closely with individuals and help them live their best lives. Every day is different and I learn something new from people all the time. One of the most rewarding parts of my job is seeing individuals make progress towards their goals. Whether it's learning a new skill or gaining more independence, it's amazing to see the positive impact that my work can have on their lives. I also enjoy working collaboratively with other professionals in the disability sector, such as occupational therapists and psychologists. Together, we can provide a holistic approach to support that addresses all aspects of peoplesâ€™ lives. Overall, I feel privileged to be able to support people with disabilities and make a difference in their lives. It's a challenging and rewarding career that I wouldn't trade for anything.</p>
